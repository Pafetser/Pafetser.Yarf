Yet Another Result Framework
### What te hell???
Well, I know, there are already tons of "result"-frameworks. But, just for fun, this is my personal interpretation of the "result"-framework. 
And because we already have YAML (yet another markup language) and YARP (yet another reverse proxy), why not call this, Yet Another Result Framework??

### Disclaimer
I do not intent to use this within any professional context, but wrote this pure for hobby.
I will publish a nuget, but if you use it, it's on your own risk :) I cannot guarantee your code will work and I also cannot guarantee I would ever answer if you would have issues with my code :)

If you would happen to stumble opon pieces of code that look very similar to other result frameworks,
well, this is purely coincidental, great minds just happen to think alike ;)
